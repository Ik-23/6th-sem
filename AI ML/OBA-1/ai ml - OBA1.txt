A search engine is an information retrieval system designed to help find information stored on a computer system. The search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called hits. Search engines help to minimize the time required to find information and the amount of information which must be consulted, akin to other techniques for managing information overload.

==================================

The 100 billion neurons in the brain share a number of common features (Figure 1).  Neurons are different from most other cells in the body in that they are polarized and have distinct morphological regions, each with specific functions.  Dendrites are the region where one neuron receives connections from other neurons. 

If there is a replacement of neurons with electronic neurons, it will affect the human brains and they may suffer to many diseases/problems.
Our perceptions won't be same as of normal human beings. We would be controlled by the AI, having no emotions or caring or affections towards anyone. We will be used for various purposes to harm the society and it's people.
We won't be conscious. We won't be human beings, we will be converted into a robot to fulfill the tasks of others as a source of medium.
We won't be having any merciness towards any living or non-living until the task is completed.
